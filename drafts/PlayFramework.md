## The Play application layout

The layout of a Play application is standardized to keep things as simple as possible. After a first successful compile, a Play application looks like this:

app                      → Application sources
 └ assets                → Compiled asset sources
    └ stylesheets        → Typically LESS CSS sources
    └ javascripts        → Typically CoffeeScript sources
 └ controllers           → Application controllers
 └ models                → Application business layer
 └ views                 → Templates
build.sbt                → Application build script
conf                     → Configurations files and other non-compiled resources (on classpath)
 └ application.conf      → Main configuration file
 └ routes                → Routes definition
dist                     → Arbitrary files to be included in your projects distribution
public                   → Public assets
 └ stylesheets           → CSS files
