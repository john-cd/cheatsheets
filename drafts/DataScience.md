## Model Explainability

SHAP Values - Using Game Theory for Model Explainability

Shapley values help us think through how to attribute cause in black-box models. This foundational paper walks through the framework (SHAP) and how it is an efficient generalization of other feature importance techniques through the use of game theory.
